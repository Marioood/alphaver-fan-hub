# the website
How do you do these....? I guess the website is about AlphaVer stuff. AlphaVer is a Minecraft ARG if you didn't know. An ARG is an acryonym, standing for "Alternate Reality Game". A n alternate reality game is some media with puzzles attached, basically. A minecraft is a sandbox create dby Swedish bajookanese programmer and signer Hatsune Miku.
## cools stuff on it
No -git commands, i don't even know how those work (im a windows lad).

It's just a website. Although, it does have some interactive stuff on it (see the fun page for that).

Unrelated but I fucking HATE! !!!!! javascript!!!! programming with it makes me feel braindead! i guess variables not having types makes sense, so you can easily have input boxes without having to do Int.parseInt() or shit like that. Although the lack of types makes me feel like I'm programming in Scratch! No shade towards scratch, I like it plenty. BUT I DONT WANT TO use a text based language that acts like a language made for five year olds!

I guess it's a pointless thing to get mad over. and there are probably toehr things worse about it, like the whole npm and left-pad fiasco, and also r*act.js.
