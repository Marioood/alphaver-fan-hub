# the website
How do you do these....? I guess the website is about AlphaVer stuff. AlphaVer is a Minecraft ARG if you didn't know. An ARG is an acryonym, standing for "Alternate Reality Game". A n alternate reality game is some media with puzzles attached, basically. A minecraft is a sandbox create dby Swedish bajookanese programmer and signer Hatsune Miku.
## cools stuff on it
No -git commands, i don't even know how those work (im a windows lad).

It's just a website. Although, it does have some interactive stuff on it (see the fun page for that).

Also, don't include cringe rants in read me files!
